### 문제 설명

<p>Eric developed a new algorithm to mine a cryptocurrency called Eatcoin. Since Eric’s algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm, its performance keeps improving. On the d-th day of the execution of Eric’s algorithm, it consumes p Eatcoins and then produces q × d<sup>5</sup> Eatcoins where p and q are positive constants.</p>

<p>Eric wants to become a “duotrigintillionaire”. A duotrigintillionaire is a person who has at least 10<sup>99</sup> Eatcoins. Eric plans to exploit his algorithm to achieve his goal. Eric’s algorithm can soon produce a massive amount of Eatcoins if he has enough Eatcoins. However, his algorithm cannot continue if he does not have p Eatcoins when needed.</p>

<p>Eric gives the values of p and q to you. Please write a program to help Eric to compute two numbers x and y defined as follows.</p>

<ul>
	<li>x is the minimum number of Eatcoins required to execute Eric’s algorithm to make him a duotrigintillionaire.</li>
	<li>y is the minimum number of days required to make Eric a duotrigintillionaire if Eric has exactly x Eatcoins before executing his algorithm.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>Two positive integers p and q are given in one line and separated by a space.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output two lines. Print x on the first line and y on the second line.</p>
